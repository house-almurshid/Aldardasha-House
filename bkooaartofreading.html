      <p>
        In the following pages I have confined myself in the main to those problems of philosophy in regard to 
        which I thought it possible to say something positive and constructive, 
        since merely negative criticism seemed out of place. For this reason, 
        theory of knowledge occupies a larger space than metaphysics in the present volume, 
        and some topics much discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have derived valuable assistance from unpublished writings of G. E. Moore and J. M. Keynes: from the former, 
        as regards the relations of sense-data to physical objects, 
        and from the latter as regards probability and induction. 
        I have also profited greatly by the criticisms and suggestions of Professor Gilbert Murray.

      <p>
        Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it? 
        This question, which at first sight might not seem difficult, is really one of the most difficult that 
        can be asked. When we have realized the obstacles in the way of a straightforward and confident answer, 
        we shall be well launched on the study of philosophy—for philosophy is merely the attempt to answer such 
        ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as we do in ordinary life and even in the sciences, 
        but critically, after exploring all that makes such questions puzzling, and after realizing all the 
        vagueness and confusion that underlie our ordinary ideas.<a id="footnotetag1"
    name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1" class="text-red-600"><sup>1</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In daily life, we assume as certain many things which, on a closer scrutiny, are found to be so full of 
        apparent contradictions that only a great amount of thought enables us to know what it is that we really 
        may believe. In the search for certainty, it is natural to begin with our present experiences, and in some 
        sense, no doubt, knowledge is to be derived from them. But any statement as to what it is that our immediate 
        experiences make us know is very likely to be wrong. It seems to me that I am now sitting in a chair, 
        at a table of a certain shape, on which I see sheets of paper with writing or print. By turning my head I see 
        out of the window buildings and clouds and the sun. I believe that the sun is about ninety-three million 
        miles from the earth; that it is a hot globe many times bigger than the earth; that, owing to the earth's 
        rotation, it rises every morning, and will continue to do so for an indefinite time in the future. 
        I believe that, if any other normal person comes into my room, he will see the same chairs and tables 
        and books and papers as I see, and that the table which I see is the same as the table which I feel pressing 
        against my arm. All this seems to be so evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who 
        doubts whether I know anything. Yet all this may be reasonably doubted, and all of it requires much 
        careful discussion before we can be sure that we have stated it in a form that is wholly true.

      <h3 class="text-center text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2"><a id="ch2">Chapter 2: THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER</a></h3>
      <p>
        In this chapter we have to ask ourselves whether, in any sense at all, there is such a thing as matter. 
        Is there a table which has a certain intrinsic nature, and continues to exist when I am not looking, 
        or is the table merely a product of my imagination, a dream-table in a very prolonged dream? 
        This question is of the greatest importance. For if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, 
        we cannot be sure of the independent existence of other people's bodies, and therefore still less 
        of other people's minds, since we have no grounds for believing in their minds except such as are derived 
        from observing their bodies. Thus if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, 
        we shall be left alone in a desert—it may be that the whole outer world is nothing but a dream, 
        and that we alone exist. This is an uncomfortable possibility; but although it cannot be strictly proved 
        to be false, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it is true. In this chapter we have to see 
        why this is the case.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center mb-2 my-6"> Page: 02</p>

      <h3 class="text-center text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2"><a id="ch3">Chapter 3: THE NATURE OF MATTER</a></h3>
      <p>
        In the preceding chapter we agreed, though without being able to find demonstrative reasons, 
        that it is rational to believe that our sense-data—for example, those which we regard as associated 
        with my table—are really signs of the existence of something independent of us and our perceptions. 
        That is to say, over and above the sensations of colour, hardness, noise, and so on, 
        which make up the appearance of the table to me, I assume that there is something else, 
        of which these things are appearances. The colour ceases to exist if I shut my eyes, 
        the sensation of hardness ceases to exist if I remove my arm from contact with the table, 
        the sound ceases to exist if I cease to rap the table with my knuckles. But I do not believe that 
        when all these things cease the table ceases. On the contrary, I believe that it is because the table 
        exists continuously that all these sense-data will reappear when I open my eyes, replace my arm, 
        and begin again to rap with my knuckles. The question we have to consider in this chapter is: 
        What is the nature of this real table, which persists independently of my perception of it?
