      <p>
        In the following pages I have confined myself in the main to those problems of philosophy in regard to 
        which I thought it possible to say something positive and constructive, 
        since merely negative criticism seemed out of place. For this reason, 
        theory of knowledge occupies a larger space than metaphysics in the present volume, 
        and some topics much discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have derived valuable assistance from unpublished writings of G. E. Moore and J. M. Keynes: from the former, 
        as regards the relations of sense-data to physical objects, 
        and from the latter as regards probability and induction. 
        I have also profited greatly by the criticisms and suggestions of Professor Gilbert Murray.

      <p>
        Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it? 
        This question, which at first sight might not seem difficult, is really one of the most difficult that 
        can be asked. When we have realized the obstacles in the way of a straightforward and confident answer, 
        we shall be well launched on the study of philosophy—for philosophy is merely the attempt to answer such 
        ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as we do in ordinary life and even in the sciences, 
        but critically, after exploring all that makes such questions puzzling, and after realizing all the 
        vagueness and confusion that underlie our ordinary ideas.<a id="footnotetag1"
    name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1" class="text-red-600"><sup>1</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p class="incomplete-para">
        In daily life, we assume as certain many things which, on a closer scrutiny, are found to be so full of 
        apparent contradictions that only a great amount of thought enables us to know what it is that we really 
        may believe. In the search for certainty, it is natural to begin with our present experiences, and in some 
        sense, no doubt, knowledge is to be derived from them. But any statement as to what it is that our immediate 
        experiences make us know is very likely to be wrong. It seems to me that I am now sitting in a chair, 
        at a table of a certain shape, on which I see sheets of paper with writing or print. By turning my head I see 
        out of the window buildings and clouds and the sun. I believe that the sun is about ninety-three million 
        miles from the earth; that it is a hot globe many times bigger than the earth; that, owing to the earth's 
        rotation, it rises every morning, and will continue to do so for an indefinite time in the future. 
        I believe that, if any other normal person comes into my room, he will see the same chairs and tables 
        and books and papers as I see, and that the table which I see is the same as the table which I feel pressing 
        against my arm. All this seems to be so evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who 
        doubts whether I know anything. Yet all this may be reasonably doubted, and&nbsp;all&nbsp;of&nbsp;it&nbsp;requires
      </p>

      <hr class="border-black mt-10 my-2">
        <p class="page-number text-right mb-4"> Page: 02</p>
      <p class="no-indent">
        much careful discussion before we can be sure that we have stated it in a form that is wholly true.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make our difficulties plain, let us concentrate attention on the table. To the eye it is oblong, 
        brown and shiny, to the touch it is smooth and cool and hard; when I tap it, it gives out a wooden sound. 
        Any one else who sees and feels and hears the table will agree with this description, so that it might 
        seem as if no difficulty would arise; but as soon as we try to be more precise our troubles begin. 
        Although I believe that the table is 'really' of the same colour all over, the parts that reflect the 
        light look much brighter than the other parts, and some parts look white because of reflected light. 
        I know that, if I move, the parts that reflect the light will be different, so that the apparent 
        distribution of colours on the table will change. It follows that if several people are looking at the 
        table at the same moment, no two of them will see exactly the same distribution of colours, because no 
        two can see it from exactly the same point of view, and any change in the point of view makes some change 
        in the way the light is reflected.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most practical purposes these differences are unimportant, but to the painter they are all-important: 
        the painter has to unlearn the habit of thinking that things seem to have the colour which common 
        sense says they 'really' have, and to learn the habit of seeing things as they appear. Here we have 
        already the beginning of one of the distinctions that cause most trouble in philosophy—the distinction 
        between 'appearance' and 'reality', between what things seem to be and what they are. 
        The painter wants to know what things seem to be, the practical man and the philosopher want to 
        know what they are; but the philosopher's wish to know this is stronger than the practical man's, 
        and is more troubled by knowledge as to the difficulties of answering the question.
      </p>
      <p class="incomplete-para">
        To return to the table. It is evident from what we have found, that there is no colour which pre-eminently 
        appears to be the colour of the table, or even of any one particular part of the table—it appears to be of 
        different colours from different points of view, and there is no reason for regarding some of these as more 
        really its colour than others. And we know that even from a given point of view the colour will seem 
        different by artificial light, or to a colour-blind man, or to a man wearing blue spectacles, while in the 
        dark there will be no colour at all, though to touch and hearing the table will be unchanged. This colour 
        is not something which is inherent in the table, but something depending upon the table and the spectator 
        and the way the light falls on the table. When, in ordinary life, we speak of the colour of the table, we 
        only mean the sort of colour which it will seem to have to a normal spectator from an ordinary point of 
        view under usual conditions of light. But the other colours which appear under other

      <p class="no-indent">conditions have just as good a right to be considered real; and therefore, to avoid favouritism, we are 
        compelled to deny that, in itself, the table has any one particular colour.

      <h3 class="text-center text-2xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2"><a id="ch2">Chapter 2: THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER</a></h3>
      <p>
        In this chapter we have to ask ourselves whether, in any sense at all, there is such a thing as matter. 
        Is there a table which has a certain intrinsic nature, and continues to exist when I am not looking, 
        or is the table merely a product of my imagination, a dream-table in a very prolonged dream? 
        This question is of the greatest importance. For if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, 
        we cannot be sure of the independent existence of other people's bodies, and therefore still less 
        of other people's minds, since we have no grounds for believing in their minds except such as are derived 
        from observing their bodies. Thus if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, 
        we shall be left alone in a desert—it may be that the whole outer world is nothing but a dream, 
        and that we alone exist. This is an uncomfortable possibility; but although it cannot be strictly proved 
        to be false, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it is true. In this chapter we have to see 
        why this is the case.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-center text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2"><a id="ch3">Chapter 3: THE NATURE OF MATTER</a></h3>
      <p>
        In the preceding chapter we agreed, though without being able to find demonstrative reasons, 
        that it is rational to believe that our sense-data—for example, those which we regard as associated 
        with my table—are really signs of the existence of something independent of us and our perceptions. 
        That is to say, over and above the sensations of colour, hardness, noise, and so on, 
        which make up the appearance of the table to me, I assume that there is something else, 
        of which these things are appearances. The colour ceases to exist if I shut my eyes, 
        the sensation of hardness ceases to exist if I remove my arm from contact with the table, 
        the sound ceases to exist if I cease to rap the table with my knuckles. But I do not believe that 
        when all these things cease the table ceases. On the contrary, I believe that it is because the table 
        exists continuously that all these sense-data will reappear when I open my eyes, replace my arm, 
        and begin again to rap with my knuckles. The question we have to consider in this chapter is: 
        What is the nature of this real table, which persists independently of my perception of it?
